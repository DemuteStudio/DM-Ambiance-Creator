# Issues to Fix

## Critical Bugs
- [ ] Multi select crash
- [ ] No more auto generation
- [ ] Stereo Mono Split doesn't work
- [ ] Item pitch goes back to pitch when change the value when they are in stretch mode
- [ ] Stretch mode doesn't make the item longer
- [ ] Mono split doesn't create cross fades

## Features to Add/Improve
- [ ] Add a parameter to the noise mode to randomise a bit the item position because they seem to have a min distance that doesn't allow them to overlap. Could be nice to have a control over this distance.
- [ ] Add a parameter to randomize the length of generated items
- [ ] Change "Play Emote" in the edit mode (button and notifier)
- [ ] Tweak the Auto Detect mode because the detection is not accurate enough and the default settings are not good 90% of the time with Boom
