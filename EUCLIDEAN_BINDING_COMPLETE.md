# Euclidean Layer Binding System - Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

**Date**: January 11, 2025
**Status**: âœ… ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING

---

## What's New?

The Euclidean Layer Binding System allows you to assign **one unique euclidean rhythm pattern per container** within a group. Instead of all containers sharing the same combined pattern, each container can now have its own independent rhythm!

### Key Features

1. **Auto-Bind Mode**: Toggle on to automatically create one euclidean layer per container
2. **Container Name Buttons**: Layer buttons show container names instead of numbers
3. **Individual Control**: Each container gets its own Pulses/Steps/Rotation values
4. **Visual Preview**: Preview circles show container names
5. **Smart Sync**: Bindings automatically update when you add/delete/move containers
6. **Stable IDs**: Uses UUIDs so bindings survive container renaming and reordering
7. **Container Highlight**: Click a layer button to briefly highlight its container in the tree

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Create a Group with Containers

1. Create a new group in Euclidean mode
2. Add 2-3 containers to the group
3. Each container should have audio files loaded

### Step 2: Enable Auto-Bind

1. Select the group
2. In the right panel, find the **"Auto-bind to Containers"** checkbox (below Mode selection)
3. Check it âœ…

**What happens**: The layer buttons will change from "1, 2, 3..." to show your container names!

### Step 3: Configure Each Container's Pattern

1. Click a container name button (e.g., "Birds")
2. Adjust the **Pulses**, **Steps**, and **Rotation** sliders
3. The preview circle will update to show the pattern
4. Repeat for each container

### Step 4: Generate!

1. Create a time selection in REAPER
2. Click **Generate** button
3. Each container will place items according to its unique euclidean pattern

## Visual Guide

### Before Auto-Bind (Manual Mode):
```
Layer Buttons: [1] [2] [3] [+] [-]
Preview: Circles labeled "1", "2", "3"
Result: All patterns combined via OR operation
```

### After Auto-Bind:
```
Layer Buttons: [Birds] [Wind] [Rain]
Preview: Circles labeled "Birds", "Wind", "Rain"
Result: Each container generates its own independent pattern
```

## Technical Details

### What Was Implemented

**Phase 1: Infrastructure** âœ…
- UUID system for containers (stable identity across operations)
- Binding data structures at group level
- Migration for old presets (automatic UUID assignment)

**Phase 2: Auto-Binding Logic** âœ…
- `syncEuclideanBindings()` function maintains bindings
- Automatic sync after: add/delete/move/reorder containers
- Smart eligibility: respects override mode

**Phase 3: UI Updates** âœ…
- Auto-bind checkbox (groups only)
- Dual-mode layer buttons (numbers vs container names)
- Adaptive sliders (read from bindings or layers)
- New callbacks for binding manipulation

**Phase 4: Preview Visualization** âœ…
- Shows container names on circles in auto-bind mode
- Truncates long names (max 10 chars)
- Highlights selected container's circle

**Phase 5: Generation Logic** âœ…
- `getEffectiveContainerParams()` detects auto-bind mode
- Uses specific binding for each container
- Falls back to combined pattern in manual mode

**Phase 6: Container Highlight** âœ…
- Clicking layer button highlights container (1 second)
- Visual feedback shows which container is bound
- Auto-expires after timeout

## Files Modified

Total: **8 files** modified across all modules

1. `DM_Ambiance_Utils.lua` - UUID generation
2. `DM_Ambiance_Structures.lua` - Core binding system
3. `DM_Ambiance_Presets.lua` - Migration support
4. `DM_Ambiance_Constants.lua` - New constants
5. `DM_Ambiance_UI.lua` - UI components and callbacks
6. `DM_Ambiance_UI_Groups.lua` - Sync calls and highlighting
7. `DM_Ambiance_UI_Container.lua` - Override handling
8. `DM_Ambiance_UI_MultiSelection.lua` - Multi-select support

## Testing Recommendations

### Basic Functionality
1. âœ… Create group with 3 containers â†’ Enable auto-bind
2. âœ… Verify layer buttons show container names
3. âœ… Adjust each container's pattern
4. âœ… Generate and verify different rhythms on timeline

### Container Operations
1. âœ… Add container â†’ New binding created automatically
2. âœ… Delete container â†’ Binding removed
3. âœ… Reorder containers â†’ Bindings follow containers
4. âœ… Rename container â†’ Button text updates

### Override Mode
1. âœ… Container with override (non-euclidean) â†’ No binding
2. âœ… Container with override (euclidean) â†’ Has binding

### Preset Compatibility
1. âœ… Load old preset â†’ UUIDs added automatically
2. âœ… Save with auto-bind â†’ Bindings preserved
3. âœ… Load preset with bindings â†’ Everything restored

---

## Known Behaviors

### Expected:
- Auto-bind only available for **groups** (not containers)
- +/- buttons hidden in auto-bind mode (container count controls layer count)
- Clicking layer button highlights container for 1 second
- Preview circles are concentric (superposed, not side-by-side)

### By Design:
- Container without override uses group's binding
- Container with override (euclidean) gets its own binding
- Container with override (non-euclidean) has no binding
- Manual mode (auto-bind off) combines all layers via OR

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Why UUIDs?
Containers frequently move/reorder via drag-and-drop. Positional indices change with every operation, but UUIDs remain stable forever.

### Why Bindings at Group Level?
Follows the existing inheritance model: groups control parameters, containers inherit. Centralized storage makes management easier.

### Why `euclideanBindingOrder` Array?
Lua tables have undefined iteration order. The order array ensures deterministic rendering of buttons/circles in the same sequence as containers appear in the tree.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Launch REAPER**
2. **Load the script** from Actions menu
3. **Create test project**:
   - 1 group in Euclidean mode
   - 3 containers with different audio files
4. **Enable auto-bind** and configure patterns
5. **Generate** with time selection
6. **Verify** each container has its unique rhythm!

---

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check REAPER console for error messages
2. Verify all containers have unique IDs (load a preset to trigger migration if needed)
3. Try disabling/re-enabling auto-bind to force sync
4. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for detailed technical documentation
