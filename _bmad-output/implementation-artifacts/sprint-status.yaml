# Notes
notes:
  - "Epic 5 contains critical bug fixes discovered post-implementation"
  - "Story 5.2 is a regression from Story 1.2 - multichannel distribution was supposed to work"
  - "Stories 5.4 and 5.5 discovered during manual testing - affect item spacing in All Tracks and Round-Robin modes"
  - "Story 5.6 discovered during Story 5.4 testing - CRITICAL multi-channel preserve loop desync"
  - "All bugs affect core export functionality and should be fixed before production use"
