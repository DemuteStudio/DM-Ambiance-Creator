# Multi-Channel Support Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented multi-channel support for the DM-Ambiance Creator, allowing users to generate ambiances in various surround formats (4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 7.1) in addition to the default stereo mode.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Channel Configurations
- **Default (Stereo)**: Standard 1/2 routing (unchanged from original)
- **4.0 Quad**: 4 channels (Front L/R, Rear L, Rear R)
- **5.0 Surround**: 5 channels (Front L/R, Center, Rear L/R)
- **5.1 Surround**: 6 channels (Front L/R, Center, LFE, Rear L/R)
- **7.1 Surround**: 8 channels (Front L/R, Center, LFE, Rear L/R, Side L/R)

### 2. Distribution Modes
- **Random**: Items randomly placed on different channels
- **Round-Robin**: Items distributed sequentially across channels
- **All Channels**: Items duplicated on all channels simultaneously

### 3. Per-Channel Controls
- Individual pan control for each channel track
- Individual volume control for each channel track
- Settings preserved in presets

## User Interface Changes

### Container Settings Panel
1. **Channel Mode Dropdown**: Select between Default, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, and 7.1
2. **Item Distribution Dropdown**: Choose Random, Round-Robin, or All Channels (visible only in multi-channel modes)
3. **Channel Settings**: Individual Pan (-1.0 to 1.0) and Volume (-12 to +12 dB) sliders for each channel

## Technical Implementation

### Track Structure
- In multi-channel mode, container track becomes a folder
- Child tracks are created for each channel
- Each child track is:
  - Named with container name + channel description
  - Routed to appropriate output channels
  - Configured with individual pan/volume settings

### Routing Configuration
- Child tracks have master send disabled
- Each track sends to parent container with specific channel routing
- Container track channel count adjusted to accommodate all channels

### Generation Process
1. Checks if existing tracks match selected channel configuration
2. Creates/recreates track structure as needed
3. Distributes items according to selected distribution mode
4. Applies per-channel settings (pan/volume)

## Backward Compatibility
- Default mode works exactly as before
- Existing projects remain unchanged
- Old presets continue to work

## Files Modified

1. **DM_Ambiance_Constants.lua**: Added channel configuration constants
2. **DM_Ambiance_Structures.lua**: Added multi-channel properties to container structure
3. **DM_Ambiance_Utils.lua**: Added routing configuration helper
4. **DM_Ambiance_Generation.lua**: Implemented multi-channel track creation and item distribution
5. **DM_Ambiance_UI_Container.lua**: Added UI controls for channel configuration
6. **DM_Ambiance_Presets.lua**: No changes needed (automatic serialization)

## Usage

### Creating a Multi-Channel Ambiance
1. Select a container in the Ambiance Creator
2. In the Container Settings panel, choose a Channel Mode
3. Select an Item Distribution mode
4. Adjust per-channel Pan and Volume as desired
5. Generate the ambiance

### Switching Channel Modes
- Changing channel mode after generation will recreate the track structure
- Settings are preserved when switching modes
- Regenerating updates the existing structure

## Benefits
- **Professional Audio Production**: Support for standard surround formats
- **Flexible Distribution**: Multiple ways to spread sounds across channels
- **Fine Control**: Individual channel adjustments for precise spatial placement
- **Easy Workflow**: Simple dropdown selection, no complex routing setup required
- **Preset Support**: All settings saved and restored with presets

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test each channel mode with different distribution settings
2. Verify routing by monitoring individual channel outputs
3. Test regeneration when switching between modes
4. Save and load presets with different configurations
5. Test with existing projects for backward compatibility

## Future Enhancements (if needed)
- Ambisonic support
- Custom channel configurations
- Channel-specific effects processing
- Spatial automation over time
- 3D positioning interface
